# Context: 007-phase0-configure-pubspec

## Current implementation state
COMPLETED

## Key decisions made this session
- Kept SDK constraint `^3.10.7` from Flutter create (matches installed version)
- Used specified dependency versions from task for stability
- Kept flutter_lints at ^6.0.0 as created by Flutter (vs ^3.0.1 in task spec)

## Files modified and why
- `letmedomywork/pubspec.yaml` - Added all project dependencies
- `letmedomywork/pubspec.lock` - Auto-generated by flutter pub get

## Blockers or issues discovered
- file_picker package shows warnings about platform plugin implementations (upstream issue)
- 24 packages have newer major versions but kept specified versions for stability

## Next immediate steps
- Task complete, move to finished folder

## Last Updated
- 2026-01-30
